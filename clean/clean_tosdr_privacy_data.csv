The CCPA requires businesses that “sell” personal information, as the term “sell” is defined under the CCPA, to provide an opt-out from such “sales.” Some people have taken the position that when a website or app uses third-party cookies and similar technology for its own analytics or advertising purposes, the website/app is engaged in a “sale” under the CCPA if the third parties have some ability to use, disclose or retain the data to improve their service or to take steps beyond the most narrowly drawn bounds of merely providing their service to the website/app.
Some take this position even when the website/app pays the third party (not vice versa), and in most cases merely provides the third party with an opportunity to collect data directly, instead of sending a copy of personal information to the third party.
If you take the position that any of those relationships involve a “sale” within the meaning of the CCPA, then you may consider Flickr to have “sold” what the CCPA calls “identifiers” (like IP addresses), “internet or other electronic network activity information” (like information regarding an individual’s browsing interactions on Flickr.com), and “commercial information” (like the fact that a browser visited a particular page on our website) to those sorts of companies.

Google procède ensuite à des recoupements de données afin qu'une publicité s'affiche sur le réseau de recherche des personnes qu'elle est parvenue à identifier.

Google Analytics</strong>
</p>
<p>
<i>
<strong>Comment fonctionne Google Analytics?</strong>
</i>
<br>
</p>
<p>Nous utilisons Google Analytics, un service de Google Ireland Ltd.
(Google Building Gordon House, Barrow St, Dublin 4, Irlande) sur nos sites web.
Google se sert de cookies, qui sont stockés sur votre ordinateur et permettent d'analyser l'utilisation de nos pages web.
Les informations générées par les cookies sont généralement transférées à un serveur de Google aux États-Unis où elles sont stockées.
Nous avons ajouté à Google Analytics le code ""anonymizeIP"", afin de nous assurer que toutes les données sont recueillies de manière anonyme.
Ce n'est qu'exceptionnellement que votre adresse IP complète est transmise à un serveur de Google aux Etats-Unis pour être tronquée là-bas.<br>
</p>
<p>
<i>
<strong>Pourquoi utilisons-nous Google Analytics?</strong>
</i>
<br>
</p>
<p>Sur mandat de notre part, Google évalue les données collectées afin que nous puissions nous faire une idée des visites effectuées et du comportement de navigation sur nos pages web.
Ce qui nous offre la possibilité d'améliorer la conception de nos services et de nos contenus.<br>
</p>
<p>
<i>
<strong>Quelles autres fonctions utilisons-nous?</strong>
</i>
<br>
</p>
<p>Nous nous servons également de cookies pour des campagnes de remarketing.
Ces fonctions permettent d'associer les groupes publicitaires cibles créés avec Google Analytics Remarketing aux fonctions multi-appareils de Google AdWords et Google DoubleClick.
Ainsi, nous pouvons afficher sur un terminal (p.ex.
tablette ou PC) des messages publicitaires personnalisés et ciblés sur vos intérêts, qui résultent de votre comportement d'utilisation et de navigation sur un autre appareil (p.
ex.
un smartphone).
Si vous avez donné votre consentement à Google, cette dernière associe à votre compte Google vos historiques de navigation sur le web et sur les applis.
Ainsi, les mêmes messages publicitaires personnalisés s'afficheront sur tous les appareils que vous utilisez en étant connecté à votre compte Google.
Pour cette fonction, Google Analytics recueille des identifiants authentifiés, qui sont temporairement combinés à nos données Google Analytics afin de définir et de créer des groupes-cibles pour la publicité multi-appareils.<br>
</p>
<p>
<b>
<i>Comment pouvez-vous empêcher la collecte de vos données via Google Analytics?</i>

Pixel Meta et Custom Audience</strong>
</p>
<p>
<i>
<strong>Comment fonctionnent le pixel Meta et l'outil Custom Audience?</strong>
</i>
<br>
</p>
<p>Nos sites web utilisent le pixel Meta (Meta Platforms Ireland Ltd., Harbour 4, Grand Canal Quay, Grand Canal Bridge, Dublin 2, Irlande) pour effectuer des mesures de conversion.
Le pixel Meta nous permet de suivre votre comportement lorsque vous atteignez notre site web après avoir cliqué sur une annonce publicitaire Facebook.
Les données collectées sont anonymes pour nous, en tant qu'exploitant du site, et ne permettent pas d'établir de recoupements avec votre personne.<br>
</p>
<p>
<i>
<strong>Pourquoi utilisons-nous le pixel Meta?</strong>
</i>
<br>
</p>
<p>Nous utilisons le pixel Meta pour évaluer l'efficacité des annonces publicitaires Facebook à des fins de statistiques et d'études de marché et pour optimiser nos prochaines mesures publicitaires.<br>
</p>
<p>De plus, nous avons recours à Custom Audience afin de cibler nos annonces publicitaires Facebook sur les personnes ayant déjà manifesté un intérêt pour nos offres ou ayant des intérêts similaires.
À cet effet, nous lui communiquons vos adresses mail sous forme cryptée et pseudonymisée (hashing), afin de permettre une comparaison avec la base de données et de sélectionner des utilisateurs ayant le même profil (voir à ce propos le point 8.3).
Au cours de ce processus, Facebook n'a pas accès à de nouvelles adresses mail qu'elle pourrait exploiter à ses propres fins.<br>
</p>
<p>Si vous ne souhaitez pas recevoir d'annonces publicitaires personnalisées de Facebook, vous pouvez le signifier dans les paramètres de l'application.<br>
</p>
<p>
<i>
<strong>Qui est responsable du traitement des données personnelles?</strong>
</i>
<br>
</p>
<p>Facebook et nous-mêmes assumons une responsabilité conjointe pour l'échange de données que Facebook collecte ou obtient par l'intermédiaire du pixel Meta ou de fonctionnalités comparables, pour l'affichage d'informations publicitaires correspondant au profil des visiteurs, pour l'amélioration du ciblage des annonces et pour la personnalisation des fonctions et contenus.
Vous pouvez donc adresser des demandes de renseignements ou d'autres requêtes relevant du droit de la protection des données directement à Facebook.<br>
</p>
<p>Nous déclinons toute responsabilité pour tout autre traitement de données.
